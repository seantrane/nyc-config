### BREAKING CHANGES

* **package:** version reset

This is compatible with v1. The v2 release is only a version-reset.
:pray: this bump fixes an issue with npm publish E400 error:
"Cannot publish over previously published version"
...could not resolve this, so trying a clean slate with new version.
